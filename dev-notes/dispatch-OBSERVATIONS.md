# Dispatch observations — gaps noticed in use

Per the dispatch skill's "Evolution and maintenance": a dispatch failure the
discipline should have prevented, or a rule it states wrongly, gets written here
with its evidence, and the rule change proposed. Not a changelog — each entry is
a measured incident.

## 2026-08-06 — three from one fan-out (3 × opus, two fork worktrees + one shared repo)

Context: three parallel lanes dispatched from a cache-fix session; two in git
worktrees of one repo, one in the operator's dotfiles repo. All three delivered.
The failures below are the dispatcher's, and two of them are holes in the rules
rather than slips against them.

### 1. "Commit unpushed" is not enforceable on a working copy a PEER SESSION shares

The strongest observation of the three, because it defeats a rule that reads as
airtight. §1 says commits are unpushed and pushing is the dispatcher's act after
verification; §5 denies subagent pushes mechanically. Both held. The agent's
commit reached the remote anyway — a **peer session** working in the same repo
ran its own `git push`, and the push set is the branch, so it published the
agent's mid-verification work along with its own three commits.

Measured: the lane's `git/hooks/pre-push` rewrite (270 lines) was on the dotfiles
remote before the dispatcher had verified any of it; `git rev-list --count
origin/main..HEAD` returned 0 where the dispatcher expected 1.

The existing rule covers this from the PUSHER's side (claim each outgoing commit;
an unexpected commit halts the push) and that rule is what the peer skipped. What
is missing is the DISPATCHER's side: when the assigned working copy is shared
with any writer outside the dispatch — a peer session, the operator, a scheduled
job — "unpushed" is a hope, not a boundary. Proposed rule text for §1's write
boundaries: *a working copy shared with a writer outside this dispatch cannot
hold work unpushed; either isolate the lane in a worktree, or accept that its
commits may be published before verification and say so in the brief.* The
worktree ladder already exists for overlap between AGENTS; this extends its
trigger to overlap with sessions the dispatcher does not control.

### 2. The brief boxed DEPLOYMENT and missed LIVE-ON-WRITE

The same lane edited two hooks. The brief explicitly boxed one — build and test
the Claude PreToolUse hook, do not register or deploy it, registration is the
operator's act — precisely to keep a half-built guard from denying legitimate
work mid-session. It said nothing about the other, because deployment was the
axis in mind.

But global `core.hooksPath` pointed at the repo's `git/hooks/` directory, so that
file **is** the live gate for every `git push` on the machine, active from the
moment it is written — no commit, no deploy, no restart. The machine's last check
before public history was under construction while the dispatcher's own pushes
ran through it. Nothing went wrong; that is luck, not design.

Proposed: the write-boundary section asks not only *what is deployment-coupled*
but *what is live on write* — anything on an execution path resolved by PATH
rather than by import (git hooks under `core.hooksPath`, harness hooks already
registered, files a running daemon re-reads, anything under a watched directory).
The two questions have different answers and only one of them was being asked.

### 3. The worktree push-denial recipe, applied without loading the worktree skill

§1's ladder says to create per-agent worktrees and "apply the skill's push denial
to EVERY remote". The dispatcher did the obvious thing — `git remote set-url
--push <remote> no-push-from-worktree`, run inside each worktree — and disabled
push for the MAIN clone, because remote config is shared across worktrees. It
surfaced later as `Please make sure you have the correct access rights`, which
reads like a credentials problem and cost a detour before the cause was obvious.

The worktree skill documents this ("per-worktree pushurl poison, never
remote-remove"). The gap is not the rule, it is the seam: the dispatch skill
names the worktree skill as the single source and the dispatcher improvised the
one step it delegates. Proposed, small: the ladder's rung 2 says the worktree
skill is LOADED before the first `git worktree add`, not merely cited — the same
form the plugin already uses to make the dispatch skill's own load mandatory.

### What worked, recorded so it is not lost in the failures

The §2 report form carried its weight. Both fork lanes used slot (g) to name
what they had NOT executed, and in both cases that slot held the most valuable
sentence in the report: one flagged that its "dossier output is unchanged" claim
was code-reading rather than executed (and, when asked, executed it WITH a
planted control, since a byte-identical diff is a non-event a dead comparison
also produces); the other flagged that one of its mutations had survived,
meaning the bite file had a hole, rather than quietly adding the case. Neither
would have surfaced in a free-composed report.

## 2026-08-07 — mint: terminal-idle-after-lane-close gets no reply (forms.md §2, race clause widened)

Live incident, twice in one session (statiker meta desk): the §4
mirror duty ("book the report AND tell it the lane is closed")
itself resumes the completed agent, which re-idles; the dispatcher
answered the first terminal idle with another courtesy message,
which resumed it into a second idle — a politeness loop the
existing race clause (demand-direction only) did not cover. The
widened clause names the terminal idle as a closed lane's expected
shape: books nothing, gets no reply. Placement basis: grep "idle
notification can RACE" (one home, forms.md §2); "lane is closed"
(one hit, SKILL.md §4 — the duty that creates the case, cross-ref
kept). Not mechanizable at this layer: incoming teammate
notifications have no hook surface to suppress on.

## 2026-08-07 — over-fire: the push gate matches "push" as a SUBSTRING of commit-message text

Live incident, cache-fix fork (leak-gate lane). An agent's `git commit`
was denied by the push guard because its heredoc MESSAGE contained the
word "push" — the commit was about a push hook, so the word was
unavoidable subject matter. The agent worked around it by moving the
message to a file and using `git commit -F`, which is a correct local
workaround and precisely the wrong training: the guard taught message
rewording rather than catching a fused push.

Why it matters more than its nuisance value: this is the
fires-on-a-non-defect shape the corpus names, on a guard whose whole
purpose is the one boundary before unerasable history. A reader who
learns to reword around it is a reader who will reword around a real
fire. The dispatcher hit the same class separately — a compound
`git push … | tail` plus a `git log` claim check in one command — where
the gate was RIGHT; the two are hard to tell apart from the deny text
alone.

Proposed: the lane should key on the command's VERB position (an
argv-level `git push`), not on the token appearing anywhere in the
command string including quoted message bodies. Naming the distinction
in the deny text would also help — "a git push in this command" vs
"the word push inside a message" are different findings.

Not fixed here: this is an observation from a consuming repo, and the
lane's own docstring is canonical for its predicate. Reported per the
skill's evolution rule rather than patched from outside.

## 2026-08-07 — a brief cut from a ranked-list head inherits the list's staleness

Dispatched (statiker meta session): implement cache-fix BACKLOG Tier B
item 17. The executing agent's first read found the entry body already
grade-marked "(DONE — f2ab6d0)" — landed by another session 70 minutes
before the dispatch — and correctly halted with zero writes. The
dispatcher had read the ranked head (which still listed the item) and
two body windows that straddled the grade header without covering it;
the brief's "Background" section then shipped the stale state as fact
("4 of 85 captures failing"), which the executor had to overturn.
Cost: one full opus dispatch spent verifying landed state.

Candidate rule (§1, near the base-commit clause): a brief cut from a
backlog/ranked-list entry states the entry's GRADE LINE as read at
cut time — the one-line body read is the staleness probe, and a head
or index line is never the basis (the corpus paraphrase-drift rule,
applied at brief-cut). Secondary find, same root, reported to the
target repo's own round: the repo's order/lint checkers both pass over
a DONE-graded bullet still holding a rank anchor, so the ranked head
can never notice its own staleness mechanically.

## 2026-08-07 — the base-check halt rule has nothing to say about commits that land DURING the dispatch

Dispatched (dotfiles): migrate this repo's own hook state out of
`~/.claude/` to XDG. The brief carried the §1 base check verbatim —
both reads, three states — and the executor ran it cleanly: base
contained, nothing on top. The dispatcher had verified the same state
independently a minute earlier.

Then a concurrent session in the same working copy landed four commits
mid-dispatch, three of them touching `claude/hooks/**`. The brief had
added a repo-specific clause — "if any touches `claude/hooks/**`, HALT
and report" — written for the START state, where it sits next to the
base check. Read at commit time it appeared to fire, and the executor
surfaced it as a decision rather than acting on it: none of those three
files was in its write set, and it judged that leaving five files (one
untracked) in a copy another session was actively committing in was the
more dangerous state. It committed and escalated the question. That
judgment was right — the dispatcher confirmed zero file overlap and
ruled no reversal — but it cost a round trip, and a cheaper tier would
plausibly have halted with the work stranded.

The gap: §1's three-state base rule is entirely about SPAWN-TIME state.
It is the right shape for that and says nothing about a co-writer
committing while the dispatch runs, which is a normal condition on a
shared working copy — the same copy the disjointness rules already
anticipate for WRITES.

Candidate rule (§1, appended to the base-commit clause): the base check
governs the START state and says so explicitly; commits landing
afterwards are judged by WRITE-SET OVERLAP, not by directory or path
shape. Overlap halts, disjoint proceeds and is reported. A brief adding
its own halt predicate states which of the two moments it binds — a
path-shaped predicate written beside the base check reads as start-state
to the writer and as continuous to the executor, and those differ
exactly when a co-writer is live.

Secondary observation, same dispatch: the dispatcher's "verify, then
integrate" duty assumes the dispatcher controls the push. Here the
concurrent session pushed the agent's commit before verification
finished. Nothing broke — the commit passed — but on a shared copy the
integration seam is not the dispatcher's to hold by convention alone,
and §4 currently reads as though it were.

## 2026-08-07 — a read-only lane's working copy grew push-denial config, unreported

During a read-only discovery dispatch into a sibling repo's MAIN
clone, both remotes' pushurl were set to `DENY-worktree-push` (the
worktree skill's every-remote recipe) at a timestamp inside the
lane's window. The lane's report declared zero repo writes; the
dispatcher's next integration push failed on the poison and removed
it after reading the evidence (main clone, `--git-dir` = `.git`, not
a worktree — the recipe's own scope is per-worktree). Two candidate
rules once attribution lands (question sent to the agent): (1) the
worktree skill's denial recipe states its scope test (`git rev-parse
--git-dir` ends in `.git/worktrees/<name>`, else DO NOT poison);
(2) §2's report form: config writes are repo writes — a lane that
touches `.git/config` reports it under files touched, read-only
briefs included.

RESOLVED same day — the lane is EXONERATED (its denial carries
checkable corroboration: no `git config` invocation, git-less probe
copies, timeline closed by the dispatcher's own unset explaining the
second mtime). The writer was a CONCURRENT SESSION's worktree lane:
`git worktree list` on the clone shows a scratch worktree belonging to
another session id, and worktrees SHARE `.git/config`, so that lane's
every-remote pushurl denial (the recipe followed faithfully) landed
repo-wide — the worktree skill's shared-config hazard playing out
across two sessions, each individually disciplined. The dispatcher
restored the denial after its own push (the other session's
established state stands). Rule candidates replace the earlier two:
(1) worktree skill: the pushurl-poison step states that in a SHARED
config it denies the whole clone — per-worktree scope needs
`extensions.worktreeConfig`; a lane on a shared clone poisons at
dispatch and REMOVES at integration, or the dispatcher owns the
toggle. (2) dispatch skill §4, the one-writer check: `git status`
does not see worktrees — the co-writer census before integrating in
any clone is `git worktree list` + status, and a scratch-path
worktree with a FOREIGN session id is a live co-writer whatever the
tree says.
